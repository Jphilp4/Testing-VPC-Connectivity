# Testing VPC Connectivity in AWS  

## **Project Overview**  
In this project, I focused on testing and validating **network connectivity within an AWS VPC**, including **instance communication**, **internet access**, and **SSH connectivity** without key pair management.  

## **Project Highlights**  

### **What I Did:**  
🔐 **Enabled SSH Access Without Key Pairs**  
- Used **EC2 Instance Connect** to securely SSH into a **public EC2 instance**—no need to manage key pairs.  

📶 **Verified Internal Network Communication**  
- Confirmed connectivity between **public and private EC2 instances** via `ping`, validating internal routing and subnet setup.  

🌍 **Tested Internet Access**  
- Ran `curl` commands from within the VPC to verify outbound connectivity and **NAT/IGW configuration**.  

### **Next Steps:**  
🧪 Add **automated connectivity checks** using bash scripts for routine validation.  
📈 Integrate **CloudWatch** to monitor network activity and detect issues early.  

## **Why This Matters?**  
Establishing **secure and functional communication** in a VPC is foundational to AWS networking. This hands-on testing gave me practical knowledge of **routing, firewall rules, and connectivity diagnostics** across private/public cloud environments.
